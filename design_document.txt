// in thread/thread.h
struct thread 
  {
    tid_t tid;
    enum thread_status status;
    char name[16];
    ... (things we did not change)

    /* Allow compatability with sleeping_thread_list, our list of sleeping threads using
     * the provided list type.
     */
    struct list_elem sleep_elem;

    /* The number that indicates how long in ticks (from system start) until the thread
     * should awake.
     */
    int64_t wakeup_tick;

    /* Facilitates the sleep and wakeup of threads. */
    struct semaphore is_sleeping;
  }


// in devices/timer.c
/* This list keeps tract of all currently sleeping threads. */
static struct list sleeping_thread_list;


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

We first get the current thread. Then, we get the current amount of ticks. We calculate the
time (in ticks) until the current thread should awaken.  We assert that interrupts are currently on.
We disable interrupts, then add a the thread to the ordered list of sleeping threads. After that, 
we reenable interrupts and sleep the current thread.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

Instead of checking the entire list, we ensure that it is always sorted from least to greatest
wakeup time. This allows us to, rather than find the smallest element each time, simply check the
first element of the list. If it is past the current tick counter, then we wake it. This method allows
us to check just one element, rather than the entire list.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

We turn off interrupts when we add or remove from the list of sleeping threads or the list of
ready threads. This prevents any thread from accessing the critical region while another thread
is modifying a shared resource.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

We turn off interrupts when we modify shared resources inside timer_sleep ().

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We initially thought to iterate through the entire list of sleeping threads on each timer tick,
but later decided that we could simply maintain an ordered list, which would allow us to more
efficiently and reliably identify the correct thread to awake. 

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

//struct that manages priority transactions between threads
struct donor_agreement
{
  struct thread *donor;                 /* priority donor thread */
  struct thread *beneficiary;           /* prioirty beneficiary thread */
  int donation_amount;                  /* net amount of donation */
};

//list of donor_agreements, to keep track of donations that have been made between threads.
//Will be used to return priority.
static struct list donor_agreement_list;

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

We use a list of donor_agreement structures, which will allow us to keep track of each
donation that occurs between threads. We not only store the thread itself, but also
the amount donated, so that we can later return it to the relevant threads.

        H
 _______________
|       M       |
|    _______    |
|   |   L   |   |
|   |       |   |       <-- each square is representative of a critical region
|   @@@@@@@@@   |
|               |
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

In the diagram above:
L has a lock, which is required by M to complete its job. M has a lock which is required by H to 
complete its job. This situation is a sort of deadlock: L has the innermost lock, but not the priority
it needs to be selected to run. M has the outer lock, but needs the inner lock to complete its task.
H has no lock, but will need both. Unfortunately, it cannot get them because it has all of the priority.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

When a thread holding the lock yields, we select (with list_max ()) the blocked thread from the all
thread list with the highest priority, and wake that one. This occurs in the scheduler.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

A low-priority thread L holds a lock that a higher-priority thread H wants to access. The scheduler
has selected H to run, and H attempts to acquire the lock. H finds that L already holds the lock,
and that L has a lower priority than H. H donates enough priority that L will have more than H, so that
L will be picked by the scheduler to run.

A low-priority thread L holds a lock that a higher-priority thread M wants to access. The medium-priority 
thread M holds a lock that is needed by an even higher-priority thread H. M will donate enough priority to
cause L to be scheduled, finish its job, and release its lock (the inner-most lock). L returns the donated
priority back to M. H eventually donates enough priority to M for it to finish its job. After M returns
that priority back to H, H can finally use the locks that were previously taken by M and L.

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

When lock_release() is called, if there were any donations to the thread in the lock, it returns them.
Then, when the scheduler runs again, a higher-priority thread, should it need the lock, is selected
to enter the locked region.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

The current thread sets its priority to be lower. Another thread comes in and sets its priority to
be yet lower. The first thread then yields incorrectly to the wrong thread. Our implementation
avoids this by disabling interrupts around the region. A lock could fix this, by letting only
one thread access the region of priority determination and yielding at a time.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We chose this design because it integrates easily with the process of acquiring a lock with
lock_acquire(). This design uses simple building blocks to deal with more complex processes,
such as multiple donation and nested donation. It covers simple cases of singular donation
with one transaction, but can also handle multiple donations across multiple locks and multiple
processes. Our previous design used a number of lists to determine which process was
accessing which lock, and had a far more convoluted structure to handle this data. By focusing
on the point of lock entry (lock_aquire()), we were able to simplify our solution and cover
more possible cases.
