Project 1 breakdown:

-pintos already implements: 
    a. thread creation
    b. thread completion
    c. a simple scheduler
    d. synchronization primitives
        i.   semaphores
        ii.  locks
        iii. condition variables
        iv.  optimization barriers

-calls to printf can be added almost anywhere for simple debugging
-at any given time one thread runs and all the others become inactive


Notes from Joshua:

-look at files: threads/; threads/thread.c; lib/kernel
pseduocode for the first project and all that stuff:

rewrite the following (from src/devices/timer.h):

void timer_sleep (int64_t ticks) {
    int64_t start = timer_ticks();
    ASSERT (intr_get_level() == INTR_ON);    //making sure the interrupts are turned on, off by the end
    while (timer_elapsed (start) < ticks) {
        thread_yield();     //should not use thread_yield in the final implementation
                            //might use timer_elapsed, but will not use a while loop
    }
}

high level notes from lecture on timer_sleep():
-lock and unlock the thread, instead of busywaiting
    -do this using semaphores, a locking mechanism
    -create a semaphore for the thread to wait for the timer
    -when it's time for the thread to wake up again, we give the semaphore a signal
-we have to create a waiting list for the timer
    -just use the lists that are already implemented in PintOS (primitives in idkwhere)
    -there is a sorted list implementation in PintOS already (which speeds up performance)
    -access of the list is a critical section (this is why stopping interrupts is important, i think)
-the thread that is sleeping is no longer running
    -the OS periodically checks the list and wakes up the semaphore on the necessary thread
-more details in the piazza post (to come)
-rather than manually using thread_block() to stop the thread, you can instead use a sempahore structure that
    does it for you

notes from lecture on the second part of the assignment (scheduling):
-move from a first come first serve ("flat") list to a priority list


corrected(ish):

void timer_sleep (int64_t ticks) {
    //get the current thread (thread.c? thread.h?) (one line)
    struct thread *cur_thread = thread_current();   //grabs the current thread struct

    //figure out what time to awake the thread     (one line)
    //      -via some calculation, which will be used when telling threads when to wake

    ASSERT (intr_get_level() == INTR_ON);

    //assign a time for when the thread should wake (couple lines, list code in lib/kernel)

    //tell the thread to sleep (the function for that will stop the interrupts)
    //      -could be thread_block() in thread.h, but that doesn't stop the timer
    //      -after some greps, looks like intr_diable in threads/interrupt.c does the job as well

    //NOTE: look carefully at the documentation to see where to turn on/off interrupts
}
