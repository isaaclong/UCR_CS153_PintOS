Lab 3 Notes
(Giving more hints on Project 1 timer part, and explanations of scheduler part)

TIMER

-I put most of the timer hints inside timer.c file comments

SCHEDULING

We want to run threads with high priority before threads with lower priority.

Implement these functions:

  set/get priority
  another yield function (based on priority)
  reevaluate priority (need this for priority donation)

  within lock release and lock acquire functions 

example:

  lock on some block of code

  L M H priority threads

  Say low priority acquires lock first
  Have a lock struck method that gets threads within lock
  H donates priority to L so that it will complete fast

  lock_acquire
      _release

  ...is where this code will run

***TA explanation was extremely fast and pretty scattered, this was the best I could get.
Add more/make changes if possible! I believe there is pretty good documentation on this too.
