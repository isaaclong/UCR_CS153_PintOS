               ARGUMENT PASSING
               ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

struct exec_helper
{
    const char* file_name;
    struct semaphore load_sema;
    bool loaded;
};

The file name is the file name of the child. The semaphore ensures that the
child will be put into the ready_list before the parent exits. The boolean
will be true if the child loaded the program correctly.

struct list arg_list;

This list will hold all of our tokenized tokens, in order specified below.

struct arg_elem
{
    char *arg;                  /* token in arg list */
    struct list_elem ae_elem;   /* allows it to be added to arg_list */
};

The list will be filled with these elements. They will be moved to the stack
after the list is completed.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

When a program starts, we get the argument string, which includes the
filename. We parse it with strtok_r(). We create an arg_elem for each
token and push all tokens to a list. Our last element of the list will
be the last token read in, and the first element will be the filename, which
we read and use as the filename.

All tokens are in a list, so we can just read the arguments
from end to beginning and have the proper arrangement of tokens as they are
pushed onto the stack. (back has the last token --> goes to the bottom of the
stack)

As to not overflow the stack page, we will restrict the size of the argument to
something reasonable, such as one or two pages.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

While strtok() maintains the internal state with a static pointer, strtok_r()
instead uses an extra argument. The static pointer of strtok() may lead
to a race condition, making it non-thread-safe. strtok_t() uses the
extra argument as a start point for the token search. The caller saves
the state, so it is usable in a multithreaded OS like Pintos.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this

In Unix, the shell does the heavy lifting of string parsing. However,
in Pintos, the kernel has to resolve all arguments, which leads to a 
lot more complexity in the kernel. Commands in Unix come to the kernel
pre-separated, allowing the kernel to assume there are no incorrect
commands given to it. Obviously, this is advantageous in reducing
complexity of the kernel. Essentially, the Unix system method handles
parsing and errors in the user space, rather than the kernel space,
allowing the kernel to be more efficient.

                 SYSTEM CALLS
                 ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

Added to struct thread in thread.h:

struct list open_file_list;         /* list of files opened by thread */
int return_status;                  /* indicates failure or success */
struct list np_list;                /* list of processes of current thread (children) */
struct pcb *cur_pcb;                /* the process's pcb, used for restoration */
//struct semaphore np_sema;           /* semaphore used for waiting process */
struct file *np_fptr                /* current file pointer */
int fid;                            /* the file descriptor id */

struct new_process_info
{
  int pid;                          /* id */
  bool alive;                       /* status */
  struct list_elem np_elem;         /* list element */
};

Keeps track of the information of the child process. It holds the id
and status. If a parent tries to wait on an already-dead process,
pstatus will help to show it's already dead and prevent waiting forever.

struct exec_helper
{
  const char* file_name;
  struct semaphore load_sema;
  bool loaded;
};

struct file_desc 
{
  char *fname;
  struct file *fp;
  struct list_elem elem;
  int fd;
};

Essentially the same that we used for parsing. We use the file name to set up
the stack and load the executable. We use the sema to make sure that parent
processes wait for children to finish loading the executable file. We use
loaded to indicate when the child process has loaded the executable.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process

File descriptors have a file pointer to the file it references. One thread has
a list of file descriptors that it has opened. File descriptors are unique
within the process itself. Within the OS, multiple processes are allowed to
access the same file, but they will have different file descriptors.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

We write a function that will verify that the pointer that the user program
gave us is valid. It checks that the pointer is not null, as well as under
PHYS_BASE. We terminate the process with thread_exit() should the pointer be
invalid. This function takes care of lots of the page cleanup.

For reading, we get arguments for read() from the stack. If the file
descriptor's id is 0, then we read from standard in using input_getc().
If it's not 0, then we get the file pointer for the file descriptor from the
list of files that the thread has open. Call the provided function file_read()
from filesys/file.c, which will fill the buffer with the data requested.

For writing, we get the arguments for write() from the stack, as with read. If
the file descriptor passed in is 1, write to STDOUT. If it is not, get the
file pointer for the file descriptor from the list of files that the thread
has open. We then call file_write() from filysys/file.c to write the requested
data to the file.

We first ensure that the given pid is a real child process by iterating
through the thread's list of child processes and checking for its existence.
If we do not find it, then we can assume that it doesn't exist or it has
already been removed. At that point we know that it is not a direct child, and
we can return -1. Then, we check the status of the boolean variable in the
new_process_info struct alive. If the child process it not alive, that means
that it has already been exited, and we can return -1 as per the
specifications. If the child process is still alive, we simply have the parent
wait on the child until it is finished.

We avoid obscuring the primary function of code with our pointer
verification function, mentioned above. The function will verify that the
pointer the user program provides is valid. It will check that the pointer is
non-null and under PHYS_BASE. If it fails these checks, we will exit the
thread with thread_exit(), and set the return status of the thread to -1.
thread_exit() calls process_exit(), which frees temporarily allocated
resources.

We force the program to exit when it attempts to access a bad address by
revising the page_fault handler. We modify page_fault() in
userprog/exception.c very slightly, so that it ends the thread if the page
fault was caused by the user and if the fault address is null or above
PHYS_BASE or unmapped.

For our example, we assume a call to write in which the user passes a null
pointer as the argument for buffer. During the system call itself, while we
get the arguments off of the stack, we check each pointer before we
dereference it, with our pointer verification function. The first argument
will pass, but when our program tries to verify the validity of NULL, it will
fail and cause the thread to exit, which triggers a call to thread_exit(), and
process_exit() in turn, freeing allocated resources in that page.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable

>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

We construct a struct that contains useful member variables. It contains the
name of the program to load, and, more importantly for this question, a
semaphore which is used to signal the completion of loading for a new program,
as well as a boolean loaded to indicate when the program is finished loading.
When the semaphore is initialized, it is initialized to 0 by the parent and
then downed to wait for the child's loading. load()'s return value goes into
the loaded variable, and the child ups the load_sema when it has successfully
completed loading.

In the case that P calls wait(C) before C exits, the semaphore that P has
downed to wait for C's exit.
